# Data Gathering and Footprinting on a Targeted Web Site

This repository contains the lab work for "Data Gathering and Footprinting on a Targeted Web Site" from the course "Hacker Techniques, Tools, and Incident Handling, Third Edition - Lab 03".

## Lab Overview

The lab is divided into two main sections:
1. **Technical Research**
2. **Public Domain Research**

### Section 1: Technical Research

In this part of the lab, we use various tools to gather technical information about a target organization. The tools used include:

- **Sam Spade**: A network query tool that provides WHOIS, traceroute, and DIG functionalities.
- **Command Prompt**: Used to perform WHOIS, traceroute, and nslookup commands.

#### Steps:

1. **WHOIS Search**: Identifies the owner and other details about the domain.
2. **Traceroute**: Shows the path a data packet takes to reach the target domain.
3. **DIG and nslookup**: Performs DNS queries to gather information about the domain.

### Section 2: Public Domain Research

In this part, we use search engines to gather publicly available information about the target organization. This includes:

- Company name
- Domain name and extension
- URLs for the website and social networking sites
- Physical address
- Names of key officers
- Number of employees
- Business partners or clients

#### Steps:

1. **Google Search**: Used to find and document relevant information about the target organization.
